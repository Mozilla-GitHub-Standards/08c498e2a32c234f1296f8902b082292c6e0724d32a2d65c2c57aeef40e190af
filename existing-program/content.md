# Using Mozilla Clubs In Your Established Club

Do you already run a weekly or monthly meetup in a club-like setting? Mozilla Clubs are designed so that they can be used as a compliment to your existing structure without changing the nature of your group. Whether a summer camp, teen leadership summit, or a local community meetup, you can embed Web Literacy into your current programming without losing your club’s identity.

## Why merge an existing club with a Mozilla Club?

Mozilla’s [curriculum](https://teach.mozilla.org/activities/) offers great educational benefits that can complement your existing club agenda. Open Source [web literacy tools and resources](https://teach.mozilla.org/) are also available which can be used to further skills in reading, writing and participation on the web.

As an established club, you already have a classroom of learners whether you meet in the local library, community centre or around the kitchen table. Mozilla clubs can be an added dynamic to your meetup, providing activities with a clear goal and outcome around digital education. We want to help facilitate your club members learning by showing you how to teach with open practices and learning through making. Mozilla clubs are formed at a local level but to are a part of a global community (and all of the support and resources that come with it).

## How to Merge your Existing Club with Your Mozilla Club

Getting started is easy.  We have the curriculum laid out and ready for you to take to the top of the room. Club captains (that’s you!) are given access to curriculum with the agenda to read, write and participate on the open web. Tested curriculum, built by established teachers and educational bodies from around the world, feature activities within each lesson that encourage group participation and mentorship.Of course, you can adjust the curriculum to suit your own needs and directives.

As a part of that global community we mentioned earlier, your Mozilla Club will have access to:

* Training Materials: We have teaching kits available online at teach.mozilla.org that will walk you through everything you need to know about the activities: what to say, how to facilitate discussion, timing, and much more.
* Peer support: Ask questions, share challenges or successes, or connect with others who are running similar programs at their community meetups in our online forum Discourse.
* Individual support: When you start a Mozilla Club, you may be assigned to a * Regional Coordinator to help you get set up and find the most relevant resources in your local and global community.
* Campaign support: Be apart of Mozilla-led or global campaigns and receive material, curriculum and support when participating.

Real-life Clubs mashup: Meet Sarah who runs an CoderDojo and was introduced to Mozilla Clubs

Sarah, from London, runs a MozLdN event in her work place once a month; she holds scratch lessons, HTML workshops and now includes Mozilla Clubs curriculum within the 3 hours meetup agenda:


> “ I was running a local meet up on the weekends for young adults between the ages of 10-15 years of age and I already had a format that was working for the day.
>
> My club not only caters to a wide range of ages but also a wide range of levels so I wanted to include additional curriculum into the Club where some kids who wanted to learn more and apply the skills they picked up via Scratch or HTML and could see these skills applied in other areas of the web.
> 
> I started by dipping into the Grab and Go curriculum on the teach.mozilla.org site but I soon realised by applying the curriculum plan I was also applying a metric to the lessons- I could see the childrens skill advancing over the 6 weeks I taught the preplanned curriculum.
> 
> The support is great- I would never consider myself hugely technical or with great digital skills but each lesson had a great support structure behind the lesson where I could read the discourse conversation, note the advice other teachers gave who had previous tried and tested the lesson with a variety of age groups and levels. The lessons are laid out in a format that is easy to apply on the day without much remixing needed.
> 
> The kids work with me on the 6 week program, we both learn new skills that can be applied elsewhere within our club agenda.”
