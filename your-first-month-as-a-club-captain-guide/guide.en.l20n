Here are some ways we recommend adapting our teaching activities to fit your needs:
""">

<fragment-6edf038c-db3a-4fbd-a349-e7b936c6c2e6 """
Format. Clubs can come in the form of daily, weekly, bi-weekly, monthly or after school meetups. The time and place for your club meetings can vary, but the meetups should remain consistent so that the learning can be on-going and learners have time to grow and complete multiple activities.
""">

<fragment-bfa50aba-fa25-4036-986c-0cbfd0eb2161 """
Time. Time is the biggest variable when running a club activity. Though we&#x2019;ve suggested time allocations per activity, be aware that depending on many factors this can often be too little or too much time. Age, web experience, number of mentors, internet connection and other factors can all impact how long each activity takes. Plan accordingly if you know you will need more time.
""">

<fragment-51c08352-0ebb-4843-b51b-4b5491924bbf """
Age. There is no perfect answer for what age your average attendees should be. The majority of the curriculum was designed with participants aged 14 - 24 in mind, but can be adapted to all levels. We&#x2019;ve had many older age groups complete--and enjoy--these activities!
""">

<fragment-955dcd79-0610-49e8-9546-dc69ac0f0e29 """
Examples. Consider having an example project, activity or story on hand to help learners visualize what they are doing and better understand the task.

<fragment-0863e6de-b68c-4e08-9349-a4f30f88903e """
Be flexible. Use your best judgment when following the activities; your unique situation will likely require you to adapt a little.

<strong>Feedback, surveys and assessments.</strong> Have regular check-ins with your learners to see how they are progressing.

We hear pen and paper is often the most effective method for quick feedback, although online forms or an informal discussion can work, too. It&#x2019;s most important to ask for feedback immediately after completion of a task or session so that the experience is fresh for your learners.
