# A Mozilla Club At Low-Connectivity Neighborhoods

> Help the next billion people read, write, and participate on the web with hands-on activities suitable for a low-connectivity environment!

You decided to help your community learn new digital skills but you’re in a place with low-connectivity or no connection at all, or maybe you do have a connection but not enough machines. You know you want to help your peers but the infrastructure is a challenge. Fear not, this guide will show you how to set up a club with activities suited for low-connectivity and fully offline situations. With Mozilla Clubs, you can connect your community to a global initiative, using participatory practices and bringing peer-learning into your low-connectivity neighborhood. 

**Mozilla Clubs add value to your community** by:
* Spreading digital skills that enable life changing opportunities such as new careers and education.
* Teaching how to participate in online civic initiatives and e-Gov processes thus making the needs and dreams of your region known to a larger audience.
* Peer learning is an effective way to strengthen your community and ensure participants get a lot out of their involvement.
* Share activities and content that attendees can then bring back to their own contexts (whether in their school, workplace, community, etc.).
* Participatory processes and informal learning tools that can be used to create and adapt activities that are focused on the same things that your community is interested in.
* Be a part of a global initiative and exchange stories and feedback across the world.


**Mozilla Clubs add motivation for your attendees** by:
* Learning new digital skills that enables better jobs and opportunities
* Learn how to leverage the web and its large audience to spread social initiatives and participate in online civic processes
* Understand how the internet work
* Looking to meet new people, learn new skills, make connections
* Learn through informal methods, by sharing, become a mentor.
* Be a part of a larger community and cause positive social impact in your area.
* Help spread knowledge about how to build the web we want.
* Empower people to put their voice on the web

###How and why you should start a Mozilla Clubs in your neighborhood

As a Mozilla Club Captain in this context, you can:
* Uplevel your own mentoring and leadership skills.
* Create or adapt activities that are focused on the same things your community cares about.
* Be a catalyst for change in your region.
* Join a global network and connect with other Mozilla Club Captains to share best practices and contribute new/adapted content.

**It’s easy to get started!** Start a Mozilla Club with an initial group of peers, experiment with our activities and adapt them to your groups’ interests. We recommend starting with the Web Literacy Basics module, which is comprised of six activities, each approximately 45 minutes in length.
* The activities make great ice breakers, with the added benefit of learning new skills.
* Help open the door to new life opportunities for you and your attendees with activities focused on professional skills and networking.
* Encourage participants to try the activities together and then to teach them others.
