# Why & How To Host a Club In A Low-Connectivity Neighborhoods

> Help the next billion people read, write, and participate on the web with hands-on activities suitable for a low-connectivity environment!

You decided to help your community learn new digital skills but you’re in a place with low-connectivity or no connection at all, or maybe you do have a connection but not enough machines. You know you want to help your learners but the infrastructure is a challenge. This guide will show you how to set up a club with activities suited for low-connectivity and fully offline situations. With Mozilla Clubs, you can connect your community to a global initiative, using participatory practices and bringing peer-learning into your low-connectivity neighborhood.

Mozilla Clubs add value to your community by:

* Spreading digital skills that enable life changing opportunities such as new careers and personal growth.
* Teaching how to participate in online civic initiatives and e-Government processes, thus making the needs and dreams of your region known to a larger audience.
* Providing a peer learning environment, which is an effective way to strengthen your community and ensure participants get a lot out of their involvement.
* Share activities and content that attendees can then bring back to their own contexts (whether in their school, workplace, community, etc.).
* Share participatory processes and informal learning tools that can be used to create and adapt activities that are focused on your community interests.
* Being a part of a global initiative and exchange stories and feedback across the world.


Mozilla Clubs add motivation for your attendees by:

* Learning new digital skills that enables better jobs and opportunities.
* Learning how to leverage the web and its large audience to spread social initiatives and participate in online civic processes.
* Understanding how the internet works.
* Looking to meet new people, learn new skills, make connections.
* Learning through informal methods, by sharing, become a mentor.
* Being a part of a larger community and causing positive social impact in your area.
* Helping to spread knowledge about how to build the web they want.
* Empowering people to put their voice on the web.

How and why you should start a Mozilla Club in your neighborhood

As a Mozilla Club Captain in a low-connectivity neighborhood, you can:

* Uplevel your own mentoring and leadership skills.
* Create or adapt activities that are focused on the same things your community cares about.
* Be a catalyst for change in your region.
* Join a global network and connect with other Mozilla Club Captains to share best practices and contribute new/adapted content.

## Activity Ideas
There are tons of great activities that encourage community building, both online and offline at teach.mozilla.org/activities. Here are a few suggestions to host Mozilla Club with limited connectivity:

* Personal Presentation Icebreakers: Sit in a circle and...
    * Share your name & fun fact about you.
    * Why do you want to be a part of this Mozilla Club?
    * What challenges do you face when it comes to digital use and learning?
* Post-It Note Q&A/Discussions: Provide a prompt and have participants write answers/feedback on a post-it note, then stick it to a wall. Facilitate discussion afterwards.
    * Prompt Ideas:
        * What is your #1 aspiration when it comes to learning about the web?
        * If you were to connect the web with something you are passionate about, what would it be? (Then discuss as a group how you can do this.)
* Lo-Fi, No-Fi Activities: These are key in a limited or no connectivity environment! It encourages teamwork, provides opportunity for great discussion, and can surface opportunities to build a stronger sense of community within your group dynamic. These can be especially fun when hosting a larger event that includes outside community members.
    * [Studio.code.org](https://studio.code.org) offers many “unplugged” activities for those with no prior programming experience.
    * [Teach.mozilla.org](https://teach.mozilla.org) offers 19 activities in this lo-fi, no-fi teaching kit.
* Group Hack/Remix Challenges: When you do have connectivity, give these a try. Whatever tool or challenge you decide to use, pair your participants into teams to work together to achieve a goal. Add a bit of playful competition between teams by adding time restrictions, small prizes, or bragging rights. If unable to use online tools, simple print out a copy of the site or page and have learners go through the steps as if they were following online. If they are able to afterwards, they can complete the activity at home, school or another place they can access a computer/internet.
