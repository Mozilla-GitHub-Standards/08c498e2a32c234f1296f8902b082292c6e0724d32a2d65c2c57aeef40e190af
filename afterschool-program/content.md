# Mixing Your Afterschool Program & Your Mozilla Club

Mozilla Clubs offer an opportunity to regularly bring digital literacy skills into an afterschool environment and participate in a global community of teachers and learners.  Afterschool programs are the ideal setting for educators and participants to teach and learn digital literacy skills by adapting Mozilla Club curriculum. Any afterschool provider interested in learning web literacy skills to help facilitate positive experiences in their programs, and create new and innovative hands-on activities can lead the effort.

Mozilla Club curriculum can be incorporated into existing programming over a month, a 6-8 week period or a weeklong  summer camp module, or during professional development days.

There are many benefits of mixing your afterschool program with Mozilla Club:
* Connect with hands-on learning activities where afterschool educators and participants learn how to read, write, and participate on the Web, teach others, and learn together.  
* Empower afterschool educators with professional development opportunities that will continually bring them up to speed on the latest web literacy skills.
* Combine these Web Literacy skills with current and new projects that are on and off-line.
* Strengthen your afterschool program by teaching core web literacy skills to students that will enhance in-school learning and STEM skillset.
* Participate in global campaigns such as Data Privacy Day, International Women’s Day, Maker Party etc.

# Activity Ideas
At your next staff meeting, share the [Mozilla Clubs activities](https://teach.mozilla.org/activities/) and determine how to adapt the activities to your afterschool program.  The [Web Literacy Basics module](https://teach.mozilla.org/activities/web-lit-basics/), which is comprised of six activities, each approximately 45 minutes in length are a great way to start and is easily adaptable for many age groups. Participants can try these activities together, and a takeaway assignment could be to teach to their parents or other adults in their lives as part of a project.

There are lots of activities, both online and offline at [teach.mozilla.org/activities](http://teach.mozilla.org/activities). Here are a few suggestions to make the most of your afterschool program/Mozilla Club mix:
* Personal Presentation Icebreakers: Sit in a circle and...
  * When was the first time you remember using the web?
  * What is one thing you would love to learn about the web?
  * What challenges do you face when it comes to digital use and learning?
* Post-It Note Q&A/Discussions: Provide a prompt and have participants write answers/feedback on a post-it note, then stick it to a wall. Facilitate discussion afterwards.
  * Prompt Ideas:
    * If you had to describe the web in one word, what would it be? Why?
    * If you were to connect the web with something you are passionate about, what would it be? (Then discuss as a group how you can do this.)
* Lo-Fi, No-Fi Activities: It encourages teamwork, provides opportunity for great discussion, and can surface opportunities to build a stronger sense of community within your group dynamic. These can be especially fun when hosting a larger event that includes outside community members.
  * [Studio.code.org](http://studio.code.org) offers many “unplugged” activities for those with no prior programming experience.
  * [Teach.mozilla.org](http://teach.mozilla.org) offers 19 activities in this [lo-fi, no-fi teaching kit](https://laura.makes.org/thimble/MTUyODMwNDY0/lofi-nofi-teaching-kit).
* Group Hack/Remix Challenges: When you do have connectivity, give these a try. Whatever tool or challenge you decide to use, pair your participants into teams to work together to achieve a goal. Add a bit of playful competition between teams by adding time restrictions, small prizes, or bragging rights.
