# Mixing Your Community Meet-Up & Mozilla Club
Mix-up your meet-up by adding hands-on activities that get your participants making and learning the web together!

If you already meet regularly/semi-regularly with a group of individuals who come together around common interests or topics, this is a perfect opportunity to introduce Mozilla Clubs into the mix. You can connect your community to a global initiative, using participatory practices and bringing peer-learning into your existing meet-up structure.

Mozilla Clubs add value to your meet-ups by:

* Bringing elements of reading, writing and participating on the web into your context, and connecting topics your community cares about with engaging, hands-on learning activities.
* Providing opportunities for participants to make, learn and collaborate together.
* Strengthening your community by connecting with a global mission while planting local roots for positive social impact.
* Sharing your already existing groups work in a larger setting and with our global group of Mozilla Clubs

Mozilla Clubs motivate your meet-up attendees by:

* Learning new web skills, including how to read, write and participate on the web.
* Empowering others (in their school, workplace, community, etc.) to see the web as a global platform for creativity and sharing.
* Joining a global community with a mission.



As a meet-up host, or Mozilla Club Captain in this context, you can:

* Improve your own mentoring skills.
* Create or adapt activities that are focused on the same things your community cares about.
* Join a global network and [connect with other Mozilla Club Captains](https://discourse.webmaker.org/c/mozilla-clubs) to share best practices and contribute new/adapted content.

## Activity Ideas
There are tons of great activities that encourage community building, both online and offline at [teach.mozilla.org/activities](https://teach.mozilla.org/activities). Here are a few suggestions for mixing your current meet-up with your Mozilla Club:

* Personal Presentation Icebreakers: Sit in a circle and...
    * Share your 1st experience with the web.
    * Do you connect the web to your daily life or hobbies? How?
    * What would you love to know about the web, but don’t?
* Post-It Note Q&A/Discussions: Provide a prompt and have participants write answers/feedback on a post-it note, then stick it to a wall. Facilitate discussion afterwards.
    * Prompt Ideas:
        * What is your #1 aspiration when it comes to learning about the web?
        * If you were to connect the web with something you are passionate about, what would it be? (Then discuss as a group how you can do this.)
* Web Literacy Basics: We recommend starting with the Web Literacy Basics module, which is comprised of six activities, each approximately 45 minutes in length.
* The activities make great ice breakers, with the added benefit of learning new skills.
* Try a “Read, Write, Participate” theme for your meet-up for one month (or for a season) and facilitate one activity at each meet-up during that timeframe.
* Encourage participants to try the activities together and then to teach them to others before your next meet-up.
* Lo-Fi, No-Fi Activities: These activities encourage teamwork, provide an opportunity for great discussion, and can surface opportunities to build a stronger sense of community within your group dynamic. These can be especially fun when hosting a larger event that includes outside community members.
    * [Studio.code.org](https://studio.code.org) offers many “unplugged” activities for those with no prior programming experience.
    * [Teach.mozilla.org](https://teach.mozilla.org) offers 19 activities in this lo-fi, no-fi teaching kit.
* Group Hack/Remix Challenges: Whatever tool or challenge you decide to use, pair your participants into teams to work together to achieve a goal. Add a bit of playful competition between teams by adding time restrictions, small prizes, or bragging rights.
