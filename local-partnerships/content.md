# Leveraging Local Partnerships for Mozilla Clubs

> This is a *DRAFT*. This guide is not finished and is ongoing constant work.

Clubs are run around of the world by teams of very dedicated volunteers. Their experience can be greatly improved (and made a lot easier) by establishing relationships with local business and institutions. In this guide we present some ideas and methods for approaching these venues.

## Partnering with students
University students and staff can be a very powerful addition to your club team. There are many ways you can approach university (and colleges or high schools) such as:

* Students of IT/CS department can use clubs as an opportunity to improve their teaching skills. The presence of IT/CS students also serves as inspiration for learners as they engage with each others. People with CS/IT background will improve their facilitation skills and their ability to explain technical concepts in layman terms which is also great for their future professional life.
* Students of pedagogy, sociology or education background can do field work inside your club and help your team refine their facilitation and collaboration skills. They can help identify where your methods need improvement and how to adapt activities to your local context. Clubs are very fertile ground for pedagogy and sociology students.

The best way to approach such institutions is by directly talking with the heads of the departments. Before talking to the department, it is a very good option to have the support of one or more teachers on that same department. A structured project detailing "why Mozilla clubs", "why Mozilla", "why this department", "what the students/teachers/staff will take out of the project" is a must. By presenting a real project explaining the project and the opportunities for the institution it becomes much easier to establish a formal partnership.

Helping or doing field work inside a club can be a project for a given class. A supportive teacher can lead this project inside the university. Another good opportunity is students that want to do a special assignment for a class using the club as a subject. 

## Partnering with local business
It is common that clubs use a lot of office supply materials such as markers, sticky notes, flipcharts, during their activities. The costs of these materials add up as events become more popular and more frequent. Establishing a partnership with a local business in the sector of office supplies or stationary can be mutualy beneficial for the club and the business.

The club captain can approach local businessess with a presentation and document about the Mozilla Club and ask for support in the form of discounts for the materials used in the events. The same approach can be used with delis, restaurants and other places to get snacks for club members.

There are many local business owners that want to have social impact in their region but don't know what to support. Helping form a local network of businessess committed to improve the effectiveness of a local Mozilla Club is a great way to mobilize your local community.

> *Case Study*: [Rio Mozilla Club](http://riomozillaclub.org) has a partnership with a popular local stationary shop in the city they are based. The owner of this shop is engaged in social actvism and very keen to help projects that can have social impact. Thanks to their support, the club has 20% discount on supplies at the shop which quickly adds up to a lot of saving as the club recently has been doing more than 8 events per month. 

## Partnering with informal learning spaces
There is a great opportunity for advancing clubs by partnering with informal learning spaces such as libraries, city managed cultural equipments, maker spaces and so on. Many of these venues are ver receptive of programs like our Mozilla Clubs and will allow you to use the space. 

Another positive action is reaching out to maker and DIY communities in your area so that they are aware of your club and that your learners also become aware of those communities. Much like FOSS communities, the maker culture has a strong impact in digital skills learning. Bridging your club and those groups, exchanging stories and sharing activities together is a great way of engaging your learners and forming a learning network in your local region.

Approaching spaces such as libraries and museums is much like approaching business and universities. Needs to be done in a serious manner with a scheduled meeting to present the program and how it affects your local region and the positive outcomes that it can generate.

Maker spaces, hacker spaces, fab labs and similar venues are much easier to approach. Usually, a simple talk with the members or managers can get your learners inside on a scheduled day. After that you can foster collaboration between your groups and effectively turn your learners into engaged makers beyond digital making.
